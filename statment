# To create a simulated network to see if it can be used for creating mock networks for testing. 

Aims

•	To reduce risks of deploying a network. 

•	Uses tools to emulate traffic to test network setups. 

•	Setting up documentation that can be followed to easily set up a testbed network that can be configured.

•	 Set up configurations for testing faults and resiliency. 


Objectives 

•	Implement OpenNMS monitoring software from my placement to monitor and display the virtual router network. 

•	Simulate faults in the network to test the network resilience in a controlled environment. 

•	Set up BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) in the network to help simulate a real working environment.  


Problem Statement 
Through the uses of the framework and documentation provided by this project, it would help quickly set up deployable mock networks, 
that can test it to ensure that there is little to no errors or vulnerabilities. 
Using software like OpenNMS that will monitor the network and display the changes that occur from the traffic that goes through the network and see the results of injecting faults into the system. 
Modelling real-world network topology using and configuring BGP for routing.
